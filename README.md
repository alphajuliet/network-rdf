# network-rdf

Adventures in RDF and social connections with Ruby.

It reads contact data out of the OSX address book and LinkedIn, and stores it in a local triple store.

# Semantic model

The model is based on the W3C recommendations using the [FOAF][], [VCard in RDF][vcard], [Organisation][org], and [Relationship][rel] vocabularies, as set out in the [W3C paper](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-people/).

The VCard data is generated by the Contacts application on OSX using the Export VCard function.

# Running the triple store

This uses [4store][] for local RDF storage.

```
	$ 4s-backend-setup test
	$ 4s-backend test
	$ 4s-httpd -p 8000 test
```

or with `rake rdfstore:start`.
